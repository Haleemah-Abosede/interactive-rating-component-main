## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

The use of javascript to display sections smoothly and I was finally able to practice the use of .classList and innerText to add class and select values to a card.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const card = e.target;
card.classList.add("checked");
rate = e.target.innerText;
```

### Continued development

I would like to practice more of "e.target" codes because it took me a while to finally get a hang of it.
